# Original Engine Quirks

This document records gaps, contradictions, and implicit behavior in the
original game's data and engine. Each entry separates facts visible in the
shipped data from compatibility decisions made by EmperorReborn.

## Production

### Construction Yard upgrades have no build-time field

**Observed data:** The `ATConYard`, `HKConYard`, and `ORConYard` sections in
`Rules.txt` define `UpgradeTechLevel = 4` and `UpgradeCost = 600`, but define
neither `BuildTime` nor `UpgradeBuildTime`. They do contain `Resource = MCV`.
The `MCV` unit has `BuildTime = 864`.

**Original-engine quirk:** Construction Yard upgrades are not instantaneous,
so their duration must be derived or hardcoded outside the visible ConYard
fields. The exact original derivation has not been verified.

**EmperorReborn compatibility decision:** When a global upgrade has no
`BuildTime`, follow its `Resource` link and use the linked entity's build time.
Construction Yard upgrades therefore use the MCV's 864 ticks. A 60-tick
fallback is reserved for malformed configs with neither a direct time nor a
usable resource link.
