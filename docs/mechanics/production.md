# Emperor: Battle for Dune Mechanics — 4. Production

This section combines the entire production loop: building construction, map
placement, unit production, upgrades, and the tech tree. The monetary side
(gradual deduction, pausing when funds are insufficient, and a full refund on
cancellation) is already recorded in section 3 §6 and is not repeated here.

**Labels:**
- `[?]` — requires verification;
- `[Rules]` — parameterized in `Rules.txt`;
- `[→ N]` — details in section N of the series.

Status: **verified**.

## 1. Building construction

- Buildings are constructed by the **Construction Yard** — the root of the
  entire tech tree (see section 2 §1.3);
- construction proceeds “virtually” in the side panel: the player selects a
  building, it is built with progress and gradual money deduction; on completion
  it enters the **“ready for placement”** state and waits for the player to place
  it on the map (verified);
- **order management** (verified):
  - construction can be **paused** and resumed;
  - an order can be **cancelled** at any stage — including a building already
    ready for placement (money is refunded — section 3 §6);
  - **auto-cancellation**: if the building's availability conditions cease to be
    met during construction (a prerequisite is lost), the order is cancelled
    automatically. However, if the order has **already reached “ready for
    placement”** status, it remains and is not cancelled. The rule also applies
    to **upgrades under construction** (verified) — an upgrade becomes
    irreversible (§5) only after its purchase completes;
- the **construction queue is one per player** (verified), not one per
  Construction Yard: multiple Construction Yards provide neither parallel queues
  nor acceleration. Double-clicking a Construction Yard designates it as the
  **primary** one, and it becomes the **main base** (verified). The general rule:
  the main base is a **fallback return point** for units that “need to return
  somewhere” when no normal return target remains:
  - **harvesters**: their bunker is full and all refineries are destroyed → they
    go to the main base;
  - **aircraft**: ammunition is depleted and no landing pads remain → they return
    to the main base;
  - **reinforcements** (campaign): appear on the map already ordered to travel
    to the main base;
  - the list is open — extend it when new cases are found;
- **MCV** (verified):
  - built at the factory as a unit; **deploys** into a Construction Yard;
  - a Construction Yard can be **packed back up** into an MCV; it cannot construct
    while in unit form. In runtime this is initiated by giving the selected,
    completed Construction Yard an ordinary move order; the resulting concrete
    House MCV inherits that same destination and movement mode;
  - this is the **only building that appears not from a panel order but from a
    unit deployment**. Consequently, the deployment eligibility check **does not
    consider proximity to other buildings** (the build radius, §2) — an MCV can
    *start* a base, including a new base at any point on the map;
- losing all Construction Yards means losing the ability to construct buildings
  (but not units); recovery is possible by building an MCV at a factory, if the
  factory is still alive.

## 2. Building placement

Rules for placing a ready building on the map:

- **only on `rock`** (`TYPE 1`) — see section 1 §1: `nonbuildrock` is visually
  indistinguishable but excluded; this is the only “type for appearance / type
  for rules” pair in the logical grid;
- **footprint** (verified): the footprint shape of each building is specified as
  a **matrix** in `Rules.txt`. The matrix is **coarse-grained**: one cell covers
  **4 cells of the logical surface grid** (a 2×2 block). The entire footprint
  must lie on buildable cells and be free of buildings;
- **units at the construction site do not block placement — they are pushed
  aside** (verified): when a building is placed, units are displaced from its
  footprint;
- **build radius** (verified): a new building can be placed only near the
  player's existing buildings `[Rules: radius]`. **All buildings except walls**
  provide this radius; walls extend the radius **only for constructing other
  walls** (an ordinary building cannot “reach” through a chain of walls). The
  sole exception to this check is MCV deployment (§1);
- **height changes are not buildable** (verified): ramps (`TYPE ramp`) are
  excluded from construction, as are sloped sand areas (dunes). Thus, the
  “flatness” check is a separate rule and cannot be reduced to surface type;
- **walls** (verified) are a special form of construction:
  - ordered as a **line from point A to point B**, built **one cell at a time**:
    each cell is a separate order in the construction queue, automatically
    placed after the preceding cell completes successfully;
  - **cancelling one cell's order also cancels all later ones** (the next cell is
    auto-ordered only when the previous one succeeds);
  - block **passability and visibility**; projectiles with **indirect trajectories
    (artillery) pass over walls**, while direct-fire projectiles are blocked
    (3D collision, section 1 §1);
- after placement, there is a **short construction animation** during which the
  building is **invulnerable** (verified).

### 2.1 Building destruction (included here as part of the life cycle)

- When a building is destroyed, **surviving units** appear with **1 second of
  invulnerability** against the splash that finished the building (the rule is
  recorded in section 3 §7.3 together with the `[design]` deviation about selling);
- the survivor composition is always the same (verified): the basic infantryman
  of the House that owned the building; the **quantity** is `[Rules]` — the
  per-building `NumInfantryWhenGone` field in `Rules.txt` (e.g. `ATConYard`/
  `ATBarracks` = 3, `ATSmWindtrap` = 1);
- survivors spawn with **70% HP** (verified);
- no debris or ruins remain; footprint cells are freed immediately (verified).

## 3. Unit production

- Production buildings: **barracks** (infantry), **factory** (vehicles, including
  harvesters and MCVs), **hangar** (aircraft and carryalls), **Sub-House building**
  (Sub-House units — section 2 §1.2), and **starport** (batch orders — section 3 §4);
- the production queue is **one per building type** (verified): multiple buildings
  of one type do **not** provide parallel queues or accelerate production. **Queue
  capacity is 100 units** (verified); **shift+click adds 10** per click;
- **primary building**: when there is more than one building of a type, a
  **double-click** designates the primary one — completed units emerge from it.
  Design consequence: bases in different parts of the map + switching the
  production exit point between them (verified);
- a completed unit **emerges from the primary building** into the world; a
  **rally point** is assigned to the building (verified);
- Sub-House units emerge from the Sub-House building (verified, section 2);
- **population limit**: no hard cap has been found in the original — it was not
  reached in practice, and no parameter was found in `Rules.txt`.
  > `[design]` Our implementation introduces a safety cap of **1,000 units per
  > player** — protection against degenerate scenarios, unreachable in normal play.

## 4. Upgrades

- An upgrade is a credit purchase through the **upgrade panel** (encountered
  earlier: refinery docks, section 3 §3);
- **binding** (verified): refinery docks advance one refinery instance through
  three states (no upgrades → right dock → right and left docks). The target is
  selected automatically from owned refineries that can still upgrade; no map
  selection is required. All other upgrades are **global per type** (purchased
  once, effective for all buildings of that type);
- **roster expansion** (verified): every production building **and the
  Construction Yard** has an upgrade that unlocks next-tech-level entries; the
  “upgrade → unlocks” links are described in `Rules.txt` `[Rules]`;
- upgrades **are built over time**, like buildings, and have their **own queue —
  one per player** (verified). Thus, there are three queue types: buildings (one
  per player), upgrades (one per player), and units (one per building type).
  Construction Yard upgrade timing is an original-data exception documented in
  [`docs/quirks.md`](../quirks.md#construction-yard-upgrades-have-no-build-time-field).

---

## 5. Tech tree

- Form: a **prerequisite graph** — every building/unit/upgrade has a list of
  conditions `[Rules: prerequisites]`; the root is the Construction Yard
  (section 2 §1.3);
- **prerequisite composition** (verified): buildings and/or upgrades — for units,
  these are production-building upgrades; for buildings, other buildings and
  **Construction Yard** upgrades;
- **loss of a prerequisite building** (verified): what has already been
  constructed/produced remains; new entries disappear from menus until the
  prerequisite is restored;
- **upgrades are irreversible** (verified): a purchased upgrade is not lost when
  buildings are lost — the “upgrade purchased” state belongs to the player, not
  the building. The sole exception is refinery docks: they are instance-bound (§4)
  and are destroyed with it;
- **map tech level**: campaign maps impose an upper limit on accessible tree depth
  (section 2 §1.3 — the “map settings” filter) `[Rules/map]`;
- the palace is the top of the tree and unlocks a superweapon `[→ 8]`.
