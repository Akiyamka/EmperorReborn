# Emperor: Battle for Dune Mechanics — 1. World Properties

The first document in a series about the original game's mechanics. It describes the **logic**
that the engine applies to the world; specific numerical parameters reside in `Rules.txt`
and are intentionally not duplicated here—the document records *what* the engine does with them.

It complements `terrain-contour-system.md` (terrain structure) and `emperor-map-file-format.md`
(baked data): those explain how the world is *stored*, while this one explains how it *behaves*.

**Labels:**
- `[Rules]` — the behavior is parameterized in `Rules.txt` (logic in the engine, numbers in the file);
- `[design]` — a note about an intentional deviation of our implementation from the original.

Status: **verified** (checked by someone with extensive knowledge of the game).

## 1. Surface types and their gameplay meaning

A tile's logical type (`TYPE` from `tiledef.dat`, see `terrain-contour-system.md` §2) is
a contract: the editor stores a number, and the engine attaches rules to it. Rule summary:

| TYPE | Surface | Movement | Building | Special rules |
|------|---------|----------|----------|---------------|
| 0 | `sand` | all ground units | no | worm territory; spice is found here |
| 1 | `rock` | all ground units | **yes** | the only buildable type |
| 2 | `cliff` | air only | no | blocks **visibility** (see §2) |
| 3 | `nonbuildrock` | all ground units | no | visually rock, excluded from building |
| 4 | `infantryrock` | **infantry only** | no | infantry refuge (see §1.1) |
| 5 | `dustbowl` | air, hovering units, Dust Scout | no | quicksand (see §1.2) |
| 6 | `mapedge` | nobody (an aircraft caveat—§5) | no | technical map border |
| 7 | `ramp` | all ground units | no | transition between elevation levels |

An important separation of responsibilities: surface type governs **passability and
visibility**, but **not** projectile blocking. The game is three-dimensional—whether a
projectile hits a rock is determined by the normal geometry collision calculation; tile type
is not used for that.

The world's key asymmetry is that **rock is safe but limited; sand is boundless but dangerous**
(worms)—while the resource exists only on sand. The game's entire economic loop is built around
forays from rock onto sand.

### 1.1 Infantry rock

Elevated terrain accessible only to infantry. Rules:

- vehicles (wheeled/tracked) cannot enter → infantry there **cannot be crushed**;
- **protects from worms** — worms do not attack infantry rock;
- infantry on infantry rock receive a **defense bonus** `[Rules]`;
- it can nevertheless be hit by **any weapon**—there is no attack block, projectiles reach it,
  but deal less damage because of the defense bonus.

This is a deliberate design tool for “infantry nests”: controlling such positions gives infantry
a role that vehicles would otherwise consume.

### 1.2 Dustbowl — quicksand

Quicksand depressions. Only the following can cross them:

- air units;
- **hovering** units (Ordos hover vehicles);
- the **Dust Scout** (a special Ordos unit)—which can also **submerge** into quicksand:
  below the surface it is invisible, cannot be revealed, and cannot take damage
  (details: section 5 §7.0.1).

For all other ground forces, this is impassable terrain. Thus, the dustbowl is a terrain filter
by movement method and, at the same time, a hideout for one specific scout unit.

## 2. Elevation, range, and visibility

Terrain is not decorative, but it works more subtly than through “line-of-fire blocking”:

- **downhill range bonus**: a unit standing above its target gains additional firing range
  against targets below; the greater the elevation difference, the greater the bonus `[Rules]`;
- **uphill**, only **indirect-fire weapons** (a ballistic arc) can fire; direct-fire weapons
  cannot hit a target on a plateau—not due to a tile-type rule, but because the projectile
  physically strikes the cliff wall (collision calculation, §1);
- **across a depression**, units on two adjacent rocks can freely fire at each other if the
  weapon's radius is sufficient—without restrictions or bonuses (there is no elevation
  difference between attacker and target);
- **visibility is asymmetric**: a unit below **does not reveal** territory atop a cliff;
  vision from above works normally. Thus, `cliff` blocks fog-of-war revelation specifically
  in the upward direction.

Data connection: the engine takes elevation from baked `test.CPF` (256×256, uint16—
see `emperor-map-file-format.md` §3).

## 3. Spice

The game's only resource. The world (rather than economic) part of its logic:

- **exists only on sand**; field density is uneven—visually distinct “rich” and “thin”
  areas yield different amounts when harvested `[Rules]`;
- a **spice bloom** is a point-like “geyser” object and, at the same time, the **core of the
  regeneration mechanic**: it matures and **explodes**, scattering a new spice field around
  itself. Therefore spice regenerates specifically around blooms, while a field harvested
  “to nothing” without a bloom source does not return;
- **early activation**: a bloom triggers even when a unit touches the geyser location
  (it is not necessary to wait for it to mature or shoot it);
- **explosion damage** is differentiated: nearly lethal to infantry, small damage to vehicles,
  and **none** to a harvester `[Rules]`;
- **freshly scattered spice is toxic**: for some time after a bloom triggers, the area deals
  periodic damage `[Rules]`. “Old,” settled spice is harmless—infantry can walk over it
  without consequence.

The placement of starting fields and blooms is map data (`CHUNKSPICE` in the source;
see `terrain-contour-system.md` §5).

## 4. Sandworms (Shai-Hulud)

A neutral world force that acts only on sand. It can be disabled in skirmish settings.

### 4.1 Attraction and spawning

- every unit has a **“tastiness”** parameter `[Rules]`; the higher the total concentration
  of tastiness on sand in an area, the greater the chance that a worm appears;
- the trigger is **sustained movement** by a group on sand: a worm spawns some distance from
  a group that has been moving on sand for long enough. Consequently, units can move over sand
  in short bursts with pauses without attracting a worm;
- from the group, the worm selects the **“tastiest”** target.

### 4.2 Attack phases

1. **Hidden approach**: after spawning, the worm moves toward its target nearly invisibly—
   only the sound and lightning-like discharges from beneath the sand give it away;
2. **Attack**: upon approaching attack range, it partially emerges and moves toward the target
   with its mouth open. Swallowing destroys the target instantly.

### 4.3 End of an attack

The attack (and the worm's presence) ends if any of the following conditions is met:

- **(a) a damage threshold is reached** `[Rules]` — the worm is extremely durable, but can be
  driven away. Its “invulnerability” is a narrative convention: technically, each visit is a
  **new unit**;
- **(b) a vehicle is eaten** — consuming one vehicle ends the attack. The worm also eats
  infantry, but **eating infantry does not end the attack** (it may wipe out several);
- **(c) the chase takes too long** `[Rules: timer]` — fast units can “kite” the worm until
  the pursuit time expires;
- **(d) no targets remain** — the attacked group has become unreachable (moved onto rock or
  infantry rock, was airlifted by a carryall), or was destroyed by something else.

### 4.4 Fremen and worms

**There is no special immunity rule.** The low chance of an attack on Fremen is an emergent
result of three factors: their units' low “tastiness,” their lack of vehicles, and the
invisibility of all their units outside of attacks. During an attack on *another* group,
however, a nearby Fremen can be eaten like anyone else.
(The game does have a genuine flag-based immunity to worms, but not for Fremen; it belongs to
the Guild's Maker unit—section 5 §7.2.)

### 4.5 Design role

The worm is a “tax” on greedy harvesting and ground marches through open sand: it forces players
to transport armies in carryalls, split up movement, and maintain an economy with spare harvesters.

## 5. Map borders

- `mapedge` is an impassable technical fringe around the perimeter: ground units and buildings
  can never enter it;
- **aircraft caveat**: units circling in orbit (patrol circles) can *fly* beyond the border,
  but cannot be given a direct order to fly there;
- reinforcements/landings from off-map are mission script logic (`CHUNKGAME`), not world logic.

---

## 6. Weather: tornadoes

A dynamic weather event, present in both campaign and skirmish (in skirmish it is
**disableable** in the settings, as are worms):

- it arises at a **random location** on the map, wanders slowly and erratically, and disappears
  after a while `[Rules: timers/speed]`;
- **infantry** in its area of effect are immediately “sucked in” (destroyed);
- **vehicles and buildings** take periodic damage while within the area `[Rules]`;
- **aircraft** within the tornado's area also take damage—being airborne does not protect them
  from a tornado (verified).

> `[design]` The original had a bug: in skirmish, the tornado consistently spawned near
> **the first player's** base. In our implementation, spawning is truly random.

---

## 7. Time of day

A static map property, not a mechanic:

- it is set at the map level and affects scene colors and brightness (see `test.lit` in
  `emperor-map-file-format.md` §7);
- its only “mechanical” effect is whether lighting equipment is enabled on certain units,
  which is purely visual.

> `[design]` After recreating the original 1:1, experiment with a dynamic day/night cycle
> as an extension.

---

## 8. What the world does NOT have (negative checks)

- **no destructible/deformable terrain** — terrain is static; projectiles and explosions leave
  only crater decals;
- **no day/night cycle** (see §7—the time of day is static);
- **no functional neutral buildings in skirmish**. Story campaigns do contain capturable neutral
  buildings, but they use the same mechanism as capturing enemy buildings—an **engineer**
  (see the forthcoming units section). There are also purely decorative neutral buildings:
  they can be destroyed but provide no functionality.
